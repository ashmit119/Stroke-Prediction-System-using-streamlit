# Stroke Prediction System using Streamlit

This project predicts the likelihood of experiencing a stroke using a machine learning algorithm trained on medical and lifestyle data.

## Setup

If you have a Jupyter Notebook environment:

1. Open the `new notebook.ipynb` notebook.  
2. Run the cells step-by-step to see the data exploration, model training, and analysis.

Or, if using Python:

1. Install the required packages:


## Files

- `stroke_prediction_dataset.csv` - dataset used for training  
- `new notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with data analysis and model training code  
- `app.py` - Streamlit app with UI and prediction logic  
- `model.pkl` - trained machine learning model  
- `label_encoders.pkl` - encoders for categorical features  
- `metrics.pkl` - saved model metrics  
- `confusion_matrix.pkl` - confusion matrix for model evaluation  
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies  

## What it does

- Loads and cleans the stroke prediction dataset  
- Trains a machine learning model to predict stroke risk  
- Builds a user-friendly Streamlit web app for input and prediction  
- Provides health recommendations based on model output  

Feel free to explore and learn from the code!
