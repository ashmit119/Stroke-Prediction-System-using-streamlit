# Stroke Prediction System using streamlit
Welcome to StrokeSniffer â€” a personalized health companion app designed to predict the likelihood of experiencing a stroke based on important health and lifestyle factors.


Project Overview
StrokeSniffer leverages machine learning trained on real medical data to analyze user inputs such as age, gender, medical history, and lifestyle choices to provide an assessment of stroke risk. This project demonstrates the use of Streamlit for a clean, interactive web app interface, combined with data science and model deployment best practices.

Note: This app provides predictive guidance and should never replace professional medical advice. Please consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.
